# E09a-Scripting

Hello!

This Project is a continuation of the Exercises we have been working on in class.

The original code that this project was adapted from can be found here: 
https://github.com/stenixon0/E09a-Scripting (This was forked from https://github.com/BL-MSCH-C220-F19/E09a-Scripting)

In this Project the goal was to create a functioning version of Breakout. 
The ball will move across the screen, and upon colliding with a tile, the ball will bounce off of the tile and the tile will be erased.

The lose condition is letting the ball fall off of the screen three times, as that will bring the lives to 0. This will result in the game over scene.

There is no win condition (Muahahahahaha)

The background music was made by me. It took way longer to do than it should've. :P


Enjoy!
